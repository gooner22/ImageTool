*How to rename files properly

By default files are not renamed

If you want to rename file - tik option in the UI: Rename -> Rename with format

By default files will be renamed by built-in logic, which satisfies almost all cases.
If you want, you can put your own format, which consumes one parameter -> number of file.

E.g:
myFormat%d -> myFormat1, myFormat2 ..
myFormat%03d -> myFormat001, myFormat002 ..
myFormat%03d.lo -> myFormat001.lo ..

No need to change file name for:
NTU CRM PLOS, TTP, Maney / IOM, ERS (erj, erm and err), USP, JCS, PUP, TPM

Set specific format for:
- CDI
- IPEM
- JBR
- MED
- NASP
- SCI
- AMH
- BIO
- BCD
- SPER
- BJB
